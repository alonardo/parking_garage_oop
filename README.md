# OOP Parking Garage Simulator

Jody and I created an Object-Oriented Parking Garage Simulator. We used classes, class methods, and class instantiation. 

The simulation begins by asking the user to "park", "pay", or "quit" the program. Selecting "park" gives the user a "ticket number" and and directs them to a vacant parking space. Selecting "pay" asks the user to input their ticket number and references a dictionary to determine if they've paid or not. Selecting "quit" exits the program.

Our simulated parking garage has a max capacity of 3 parking spaces. If the user tries to park when the lot is full, they will receive a notice telling them there isn't any available parking. 

## Individual Responsibilities

Our responsibilities were split evenly and a majority of the project was done collaboratively. Here's a rough outline of how work was distributed:

### Jody

1. Parking Assignment Method
2. Payment System

### Andre

1. User Prompt Class
2. README
